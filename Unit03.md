**Unit 3: Negotiating Compensation** <span id="3"></span> 
*Discussions of salary requirements during the interview can be tricky. 
There are no absolutes about when you may be asked your salary
requirements:  It can be during the initial screening interview on the
telephone, casually asked during the interview, or during a second (or
even a third) interview.  Whenever salary questions arise, you are
expected to have knowledge of comparable positions in your labor market
as well as your competitive market value.  The resources in this unit
will provide guidance to assist you in researching this information and
to prepare you to get the salary you deserve!*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 1 hour to complete.

**3.1 Preparing for Salary Discussions** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*You may have had several interviews or this may be your first
interview.  In either case, the subject of salary may have the effect of
making you feel embarrassed or shy.  This is definitely not the time to
hide your light under a bushel!  Employers expect candidates to be
informed about their marketability for a given level of job in a
particular industry.  The good news is that if a question is asked of
you regarding salary requirements, the interviewer is probably
interested in learning more about you or even intends to make you an
offer.  The readings below provide information about factors to consider
when determining your value to an employer and how to turn the salary
discussion into a desirable offer.*
