**Unit 2: During the Interview** <span id="2"></span> 
*Every step in the job search journey you have taken so far has brought
you to this stage: the interview process.  You have probably sent out
gazillions of resumes that reflect your education, experience, and
career goals to potential employers of interest to you.  You now have
been invited to visit a company and convince the interviewers that you
are the perfect person for the job!  This unit offers resources to help
you optimize the brief time you will spend with interviewers to learn
more about their expectations, to convince them that you are the best
fit for the job, and to determine whether acceptance of an offer would
help you accomplish your career goals.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 1 hour to complete.

    interview.  The goal of the telephone interview is to secure an
    in-person interview.  Therefore, preparation once again is the key
    to success!  To learn how to prepare for other types of interviews,
    click on a link on the left of the page under “Types of
    Interviews.”  For example, to prepare for “Behavioral Interviews,”
    you are advised to rehearse answers to potential open-ended
    questions relating to your knowledge and skills.  Learn about “Case
    Interviews” by following the link on the left of the page.  This
    type of interview will test your ability to answer hypothetical
    questions by creating assumptions and forming possible conclusions
    from those assumptions.  Other interviews listed include
