**Requirements for Completion**: In order to take full advantage of
Interviewing Skills, we recommend that you view the courses on Job
Search Skills, Resume Writing, and Professional Etiquette.  To
successfully complete this course, please follow instructions for each
resource.  It is our intention that as you learn what the experts have
to say, you will learn how to present yourself in a prepared, confident,
and professional way to today’s employers.  At the conclusion of the
course, you will be asked to complete a final exam.   
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, it is recommended
that you take notes on and work through all materials in the course.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of
approximately **3 hours** to complete.  Please plan additional time for
note taking and exploration of embedded links of interest to you.  Each
unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the approximate amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  This should help you
determine how to budget your time to complete each of the three units.
